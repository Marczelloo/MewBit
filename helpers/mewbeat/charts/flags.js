// Runtime switches for experimental generator changes. A flag is a named set of difficulty parameter overrides per
// level; with no flag on, every chart is what the generator makes without this module. The chart store reads the
// enabled flags from a file (chartStore.js), so a flag can be flipped while the bot runs, and each combination of
// flags has its own cached charts. Names must not contain "-": the enabled names are joined with it.
